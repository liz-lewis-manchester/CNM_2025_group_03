# Pollution Concentration Visualization Tool

This Python code creates a visualisation of the pollutant concentration data over time and space using `matplotlib`. It provides functions to create time snapshots, compare simulation results, and generate heatmaps.

---

## Features
- **Time Snapshots**: Visualize how pollutant concentration evolves over time at intervals.
- **Simulation Comparison**: Compare final concentration profiles from multiple simulations.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Display concentration as a heatmap over time and space.
